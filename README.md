## Jobfolio
**Jobfolio** is an open-source, web-based application built using **FastAPI**, that runs locally and helps simplify the job application process. It allows users to track job applications, manage resume versions, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) — all from a user-friendly browser interface.
